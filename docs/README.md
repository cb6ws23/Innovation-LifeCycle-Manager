## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Lifecycle Stages
**Decision**: 9-stage model from Idea to Scaled/Retired

**Rationale**:
- Balances granularity with simplicity
- Each stage has clear value and purpose
- Matches common innovation best practices
- Flexible enough for different initiative types
- Provides sufficient governance gates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simpler 5-stage model (too coarse)
- More complex 12-stage model (too bureaucratic)

---

### 2. Status vs. Stage
**Decision**: Separate "status" from "stage" concepts

**Rationale**:
- Stage = maturity level (where in lifecycle)
- Status = current state (ongoing, on hold, cancelled, etc.)
- An initiative can be "On Hold" at any stage
- Provides flexibility without complicating stage model
- Allows clear filtering and reporting

---

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
**Decision**: 3-tier role system (Employee, Reviewer, Administrator)

**Rationale**:
- Simple enough for demo
- Scalable for production
- Covers essential governance needs
- Allows all employees to participate
- Balances access with security
- Inheritance simplifies permission management

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single role (too permissive)
- 5+ roles (over-engineered for demo)
- Custom permissions per user (too complex)

---

### 4. AI Integration Approach
**Decision**: Claude API with RAG for context

**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates modern AI capabilities
- Provides real value (not just gimmick)
- Relatively simple to implement for demo
- Scalable for production
- Anthropic Claude ideal for analysis and reasoning
- Can showcase AI during company demo

**Key Features Prioritized for Demo**:
1. Duplicate detection (high value, clear benefit)
2. Improvement suggestions (showcases learning from data)
3. Smart Q&A (interactive, impressive)
4. Similar initiative discovery (useful, demonstrates RAG)

---

### 5. Kanban Board Interface
**Decision**: Kanban/board view as primary interface

**Rationale**:
- Visual representation of pipeline
- Makes work visible (key objective)
- Intuitive for users
- Shows progression naturally (left to right)
- Industry standard for workflow visualization
- Supports drag-and-drop (future enhancement)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- List view only (less visual)
- Gantt chart (too project-management focused)
- Dashboard cards (less workflow-oriented)

---

### 6. Approval Workflow
**Decision**: Stage-gate approval process with designated reviewers

**Rationale**:
- Ensures governance without bureaucracy
- Stage transitions are critical decisions
- Prevents premature progression
- Creates accountability
- Standard in innovation management
- Balances speed with quality

**Configuration**:
- Different approvers for different stages
- Budget thresholds for additional approvals
- Fast-track option for special cases

---

### 7. Metrics & Analytics
**Decision**: Comprehensive metric tracking from early stages

**Rationale**:
- Data-driven decision making
- Enables portfolio management
- Identifies bottlenecks and patterns
- Demonstrates business value
- Supports continuous improvement
- AI features depend on rich data

**Key Metrics**:
- Financial (budget, ROI)
- Timeline (age, time in stage)
- Success rates (stage transitions)
- Resource allocation
- Business impact

---

### 8. Technology Approach (To Be Finalized in Phase 3)
**Preliminary Direction**:
- Modern web application (SPA)
- Cloud-hosted (for demo simplicity)
- API-first architecture
- Component-based UI framework
- Managed database service
- Claude API integration

**Rationale for Demo**:
- Fast development
- Modern look and feel
- Easy to deploy and demo
- Showcases current best practices
- Scalable if moved to production
