| Concept | POV | 50% | Business case weak, resource constraints, wrong timing |
| POV | Prototype | 70% | Feasibility concerns, ROI insufficient, risks too high |
| Prototype | POC | 80% | Technical validation failed, user feedback negative |
| POC | MVP | 75% | Integration issues, performance problems, cost overruns |
| MVP | Pilot | 85% | Quality issues, security concerns, not production-ready |
| Pilot | Product | 80% | User adoption low, business value not proven, stability issues |
| Product | Scaled | 30% | Limited success, resource constraints, other priorities |

## Special Considerations

### Fast-Track Path
Some initiatives may skip stages with appropriate approval:
- Low-risk improvements may skip Prototype stage
- Vendor solutions may skip POC stage
- Regulatory requirements may accelerate approval

### Backtracking
Initiatives may return to previous stages if:
- Major issues discovered
- Scope changes significantly
- Technology approach changes
- Rework needed based on feedback

### Stage Duration Monitoring
- Initiatives spending too long in early stages may signal:
  - Resource constraints
  - Lack of clarity
  - Insufficient priority
  - Need for different approach

- Average time-to-value benchmarks should be established and monitored

---

## Summary

This stage model provides:
- **Clarity**: Everyone understands where an initiative stands
- **Rigor**: Each stage has clear requirements and approvals
- **Flexibility**: Stages can be adapted based on initiative type
- **Risk Management**: Stage gates ensure informed go/no-go decisions
- **Resource Discipline**: Incremental investment based on validated progress

The model balances innovation speed with governance and risk management.
